Prediction of the scalar coupling constant of atom pairs in organic molecules from tabular data using ensembling of gradient boosting trees (XGB) and deep neural networks (DNN) methods in a separate model based meta-architecture. The project used data from the Kaggle competition champs-scalar-coupling.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Molecular representation with distance matrices and additional generated angle data used for accurate predictions of a quantum mechanical property. XGB and DNNs were found to have comparable accuracy (with XGB generally better) and ensembling these methods with a strongly separated configuration gave satisfactory results. This repository contains all code needed to replicate our results and can be modified for different methods or datasets.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Prerequisites
All requirements are listed in the 'requirements.txt'-file, simply run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install python3.7
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
git clone https://github.com/teamtoll/predicting-molecular-properties.git
cd predicting-molecular-properties
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Kaggle API setup: https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api.

### Installing

Kaggle Download:

Downloads and extracts all necessary data source files from the Kaggle competition and organizes it into a data_sources directory, ready to use.

```
cd utils
python kaggle_download.py
```
Follow any instructions given as output in case of missing files or directories.

Generated files can be downloaded from (place within ./input): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JN35qpWmMxRAXO28XfLr42ALx1w0Gcia/view?usp=sharing

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Run the notebook notebooks/main.iypnb, tweak hyper-parameters, change up the data, see where it goes.
This repository can also be used as a basis for a completely different problem and dataset.
